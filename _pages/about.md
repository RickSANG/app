##Lindi (Ricky) Sang

### Master’s Student in NUS| Materials Science and Engineering

### 🧪 About Me

Hello! I am Lindi Sang (you can also call me Ricky). I am currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Materials Science, where I focus on bridging the gap between traditional materials research and modern computational techniques.

### 🔬 Research Focus

I am currently conducting research on the application of machine-learning potentials (MLP) for heterogeneous catalysis. My work aims to accelerate the discovery and optimization of catalytic materials by utilizing ML to achieve DFT-level accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

Under the guidance of Dr. Benjamin Chen, I am exploring:

Development and validation of machine-learning potentials.

Surface interactions and reaction pathways in heterogeneous systems.

Data-driven materials discovery.

💻 Skills & Interests

Core Disciplines: Materials Science, Heterogeneous Catalysis, Computational Chemistry.

Technologies: Machine Learning (Potentials/Interatomic potentials), Python, Molecular Dynamics.

Interests: In my spare time, I enjoy exploring the potential of anything.

### Contact & Collaboration

I am always open to discussing research, machine learning, or even the latest episodes of Rick and Morty. Feel free to reach out!
